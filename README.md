# PythonExperiments
Several library tests in Python

For each directory of notebooks, create a distinct anaconda3 environment

## OpenCV
The netbooks in the OpenCV directory require the installation of the OpenCV v4 package.

It can be found [here](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/).

## ElasticsearchAnalyzers

For this notebook, the requirements are:

* create a conda environment;
* install beakerx (polyglot notebook) following instructions [here](http://beakerx.com);
* install a JDK > 8 and maven3;
* install a local Elasticsearch server

To start beakerx instead of the classical jupyter notebook, type:

```
beakerx --no-browser
```
